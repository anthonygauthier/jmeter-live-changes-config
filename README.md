# JMeter Live Changes Config

## Overview
This plugin, which is still in an early development stage __(v 0.0.1)__, allows the user to communicate with a RESTful API to change JMeter tests to change values such as:

* Throughput
* Number of active threads
* Variables
* Properties

## Why
Here are some scenarios where this kind of tool becomes very handy:

* Testing the impact of different load scenarios against a system
* Container sizing (Kubernetes/OSE, for example)
* Correcting certain test parameters while the test is running

... And many more.
